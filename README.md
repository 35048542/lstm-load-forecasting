# Electricity load forecasting with LSTM
Demo project for electricity load forecasting with a LSTM (abbr. "Long Term Short Term Memory", a Recurrent Neural Network) with data for Switzerland (01/2015 - 04/2017).

### Data: 
-   Hourly series for actual load and forecasted load
-   Hourly series for temperature and qualitative measurement of weather condition in 00000 major cities in Switzerland
-   Calendar data. Holidays, month, day of week, hour
-   In total: 20231 observations

### Installation
-   It is recommended to install the Anaconda package environment manager which installs already a lot of the required packages. Especially the Jupyter Notebook (Julia, Python and R) is very helpful for data science purposes.  https://www.continuum.io/downloads
