```{r}
library(readr)
library(forecast)

# Load data
library(readr)
ds <- read_delim("./data/fulldataset.csv", ";", escape_double = FALSE, col_types = cols(X1 = col_datetime(format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%z")), trim_ws = TRUE)
colnames(ds)[1] <- "time"
```
Split data in train & test
```{r}
trainset <- subset(ds, time <= '2017-02-01')
# If we take the full sample, we get divergent forecasts
trainset <- subset(trainset, time > '2015-08-01')
testset <- subset(ds, time > '2017-02-01')

load <- na.omit(trainset$actual)
# Set seasonality to daily, weekly and yearly
load <- msts(load, seasonal.periods = c(24,168,8766))
```

Fit TBATS model
```{r}
fit <- tbats(load)
```

Plot forecast
```{r}
plot(forecast(fit, h=5000))
```

Save point forecast
```{r}
fc_mean <- fc[["mean"]]
write.csv(fc_mean, "./data/tbats_forecast_01022017-h5000.csv")
```
